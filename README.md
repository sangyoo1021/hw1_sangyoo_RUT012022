# Kickstarting with Excel
Louieâ€™s play Fever fundraising campaign came to the end. Using Excel to visualize Kickstarter dataset, analyze fundraising goal and each individual campaign outcome
## Overview of Project
Kickstarter dataset has numerous data that contains id, name, blurb, goal, pledged, outcomes, country currency, deadline, launched date, categories etc. By filtering out what is needed, kickstarter data is studied so that Louie to see what the outcomes of fundraising campaign look like.   

### Purpose
To analyze kickstarter data and give visualization on outcomes based on the launch date and outcomes based on the goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data, first theater category is selected. Then the outcomes are counted by the created month to trend how many campaigns reached their goal. According to the chart, the plays that are large number of successful plays in April through July time frame with peak in May. There was slight higher number of cancelled plays in January and failed campaigns are evenly distributed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Again, the campaigns are trended based on the outcomes versus the goal. There was significant success rate for the goal of the campaign when the goal is less than $15000 and between $35000 to $45000 range. However, on the range between $15000 to $35000 and $45000 above seems to have higher failure percentile.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
From the above trend, one outstanding difference is analysis of outcomes based on goals are missing data for canceled. This is due to there were no plays that were canceled. But from the theater outcomes based on launch data trend, the theater category had 37 canceled outcomes which represents the difference from two data. Also, just looking at the two data, it is hard to draw a conclusion on what the goal of each campaign should be since there are no consistency for the plays.

## Results
Overall, the theater had strong successful campaigns than the failed or canceled campaigns. By looking at the data, category theater had strong successful campaigns in month of April, May, June and, July but significant decrease during the winter. However, number of failed campaigns were evenly distributed throughout the year. With slight increased campaigns cancellation in January, overall canceled campaign seems to be minimal compare to successful and failed campaigns. By looking at the data, it is hard to know what caused cancellation. 
Based on the outcomes based on goal data, plays had no cancellation but showed inconsistency through out different dollar-amount ranges. The data shows that plays with less than $15000 goal had higher successful rate but between $15000 to $35000 there were plays that did not meet the goal. But successful rate jumps back up when the goal is set between $35000 to $44999 but again sharply drops when the goal is set above $45000.
By creating spaces and musical outcomes based on goal trends, we will be able to see how successful the plays were at given dollar-amount goals. And also from the two trends, we can see how the each subcategories affect the successful rate by the launch date.
